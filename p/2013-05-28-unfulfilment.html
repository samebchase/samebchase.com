<h3>Unfulfilment</h3>

<p>Doing anything else at the expense of working towards what you want to
achieve in this life will first result in frustration, and ultimately,
a deep sense of unfulfilment.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks, however, I've been doing the things that I
should have been doing. This allows me to rest at the end of every day
knowing that I'm a little bit closer to the person I want to become.</p>
