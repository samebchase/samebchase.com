        <h1>Snakes and ladders</h1>

<p>The events of our lives can sometimes seem to be random, unconnected,
and without meaning. Some wonder if God is playing a game of cosmic
snakes and ladders; their fate determined by a roll of the dice.</p>

<p>Others believe that He is wilfully responsible for their
circumstances. Their happiness is dependent on what they perceive
their situation to be.</p>

<p>My situation in life has been quite easy, so far. I do not yet claim
to know the meaning of suffering or pain.</p>

<p>I dearly hope that if I ever feel like I'm stuck deep inside the dark
bowels of a snake, I realise that, actually, He is playing chess - in
God-mode.</p>

<p>The pawns which end up on the other side will be crowned.</p>
