        <h3>The Industrial Tour
        </h3>
<p>Most engineering students in Andhra Pradesh are made to go on an
Industrial Tour. This is usually just an excuse to have fun traveling
and spending time with classmates. It was decided that our class go on
a tour of North India - in the winter. I was worried as to how cold it
would be, as I had spoken to people who had gone earlier.
</p>
<p>The tour started off with a train journey from Vijayawada to Delhi. As
it was a Garib Rath train, the journey was pleasant. The train was
eight hours late. I was shocked by how cold it was in Delhi. We were
first taken to a hotel so that we could eat dinner prepared by the
cooks who were employees of the tour company. After dinner, a nine
hour bus ride to Shimla awaited us.
</p>
<p>A few hours after reaching Shimla, we left for Kufri, a short drive
from the hotel. To go to the top of the hill, we sat on groups of four
horses connected by ropes which were led up the small hill by the
handlers. A fall into the valley would have been rather painful, if
not fatal.
</p>
<p>It was here that I saw a Yak for the first time. Yaks are now near the
top of the list of my favourite animals. 
</p>
<p>There many other tourists at Kufri; almost all of them students from
Andhra Pradesh. People didn&#039;t do much other than drink tea and eat
instant noodles. After many photos, it was decided that it was time to
leave as it was getting dark.
</p>
<p>Getting up the hill was the easy part. The temperature was dropping
fast. A large number of people (&gt; 200) were stuck without any horses
to take them down. By then, my feet had begun to hurt. The others
weren&#039;t doing great either. Several fainted. People were in pain,
crying and generally panicking. Some of us decided to walk down as
there was no other way to go. After about ten minutes in the cold,
slippery snow, we found a group of horses and their handlers ready to
take us down.
</p>
<p>Riding down a two-way narrow snow covered path in the dark was
scary. After fifteen nervous minutes of trusting our lives to the
horses and their handlers, we finally reached the bottom. We were so
relieved to have survived what initially seemed a harmless few hours
playing in the snow. 
</p>
<p>Another long bus journey later, we arrived in Manali. After sleeping
in the warm, wooden hotel, we proceeded to the Solang Valley. It was
just like the classic mental image that I had of snowy
mountains. Snow-covered hills were all around, and snow mixed with
horse dung underfoot.
</p>
<p>The entire area was packed with students from Andhra Pradesh. There
was simply no free space. People were learning how to ski,
Paragliding, Zorbing, riding ATVs, eating instant noodles and taking
photos for their online albums all at the same time. Chickening out of
the adventure sports, I didn&#039;t do much other than go on the Cable Car
ride up a mountain which no one else wanted to go on. 
</p>
<p>Here we were all given thick, warm coats (or ski suits) and rubber
boots. It was all fine for a few hours, until my feet started hurting
again. One of the guys from our SUV (we split into &#039;skiing&#039; groups)
still was waiting for his turn to paraglide. Meanwhile, everyone else
was desperate to go, as our feet were hurting. After what seemed like
ages, our guy landed safely and we drove back to the hotel.
</p>
<p>My feet were numb by then; the right one worse than the left. It looked
like there were two different types of skin on my right sole. One pale
white and cold patch covering more than half the sole and normal, pink
warmer flesh. After a quick call home and reading the Wikipedia
article on Frostbite I started gently re-warming my feet in front of the
room heater (~ 70 cm away). As my feet slowly started coming back to
life, I also decided to do the 42 degrees (Celsius) water bath as
suggested in the article, which felt quite nice. 
</p>
<p>I had totally neglected protecting my feet on the trip. Sneakers,
rubber boots and a double sock layer are all inadequate for spending
time in the snow. I don&#039;t know how everyone else managed, but I dread
going back into the snow wearing any of these.
</p>
<p>The next day we got onto the bus to Chandigarh. We didn&#039;t do much
there apart from a brief visit to the Rock Garden. We had a short
Industrial visit and then proceeded to Delhi.
</p>
<p>Agra was next on the packed itinerary. We left Delhi late and arrived
in Agra in the evening. The gates close at 5. Our group traveled in
two buses: one for the girls and some of their boyfriends, and the
other was boys-only. The girls&#039; bus reached just in time, but the
second bus was not so lucky. After pleading unsuccessfully with the
guards (tickets were pre-bought) at two different gates, four of us
went to the banks of the Yamuna and saw the Taj Mahal from
behind. While it was quite close by, the upward angle at which we had
to look was not nearly as good as what the people who had gone inside
would have seen.
</p>
<p>One of the interesting things we did on the tour was an appointment
with Mr. Ram Jethmalani all thanks to our Class Rep (CR, for short). I
hadn&#039;t heard of him before the trip, but his very impressive Wikipedia
article, his obvious fame and importance made me feel honoured and
privileged meet him. We asked him a few questions about various things
and his answers were enlightening and interesting.
</p>
<p>He spoke for a while and went on several tangents, which we were quite
happy he did, as the lesser we spoke, the better. He was nice enough
to give each one us all a fruit drink and a box containing a generous
amount of snacks.
</p>
<p>As our hotel was close to Karol Bagh, the evening was spent
shopping. I couldn&#039;t think of anything to buy as it was primarily
clothes that were available there. It was that evening that I finally
got the Delhi-belly I had been dreading for the past two
years. Luckily, we were to leave for Vijayawada the next evening. By
this time, I was sick of the cold weather and was yearning for the
pleasant South Indian winter. 
</p>
<p>The tour had it all: there was fun, enjoyment, togetherness with
danger, sicknesses, tantrums and fights mixed in which brought out the
best, and worst in us. New friendships were formed and old ones
tested. It truly was a once in a lifetime experience that it had been
hyped up to be.
</p>
<p>Go-B4!!
