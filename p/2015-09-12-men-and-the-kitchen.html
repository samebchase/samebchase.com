        <h3>Men and the Kitchen
        </h3>
<p>One day our English professor in college decided to let the class
discuss their views on the division of kitchen responsibilies in a
modern household.
</p>
<p>Several young women got up one by one and and started enlightening the
class about newly redefined gender roles, where men and women should
equally share the burden of household chores which would result in
harmonious marital bliss.
</p>
<p>When it got too much to handle, I stood up, and with no sense of drama
or timing, quietly said: &quot;I think women should not cook at home,
because men can cook better than women.&quot;
</p>
<p>There was an absolute shocked silence for three seconds, before the
class erupted in an uproarious laughter that has since turned out to
be one of the most memorable moments of the entire college experience.
