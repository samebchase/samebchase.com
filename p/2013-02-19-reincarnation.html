<h3>In another life or a parallel universe</h3>

<p>There exists a person at two-degrees of separation from me who happens
to be non-trivially pretty. I have not had a conversation with this
person, nor have I been in a situation where I could have had one.</p>

<p>Irreconcilable ideological (read: religious) differences destroy any
desire of a relationship.</p>

<p>Dealbreaker. :-(</p>

<p>However, this does not prevent me from wondering about the
hypothetical situation in which I walk up to this person and say:</p>

<p>&quot;I can't see things working out, but maybe they will, in another birth
or a parallel universe. Farewell, have a great life! :-)&quot;</p>

<p>While I definitely intend it to be a compliment to her, it would be
creepy, and I don't believe in reincarnation anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about parallel universes though.</p>
