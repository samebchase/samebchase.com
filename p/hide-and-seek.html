        <h3>The end of childhood
        </h3>
<p>It was the last day of the summer vacation. I woke up late, and
played a computer game for several hours until four in the evening.
</p>
<p>My friends arrived at around four and it was time for the usual
hide-and-seek, one of the games we had been playing for years.
</p>
<p>After a few hours, it started getting dark so it was time for my
friends to go home. It was just like any other evening. I don&#039;t
remember feeling that it was any different.
</p>
<p>It was to be the last time I played hide-and-seek with that set of
friends.
</p>
<p>I woke up early the next day, as I had to leave for studying the 7th
Grade in a boarding school.
</p>
<p>Childhood was great.
