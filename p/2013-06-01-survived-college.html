        <h3>Eight semesters later: Sanity Intact
        </h3>
<p>I have passed four years of university and eight semesters. I think
that&#039;s a considerable acheivement. (self-back-pat)
</p>
<p>It has been an overall positive experience. The only negative is that
I could not study harder. However, I&#039;ve learned many things about the
world, about people and most importantly, myself.
</p>
<p>I&#039;m going to spend two months starting from today doing whatever I
want. Hopefully this will involve learning and doing fun things and a
bit of exercise.
</p>
<p>The rest of my life is ahead, waiting to be lived out.
