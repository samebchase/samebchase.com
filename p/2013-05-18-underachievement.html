        <p>Underachievement</p>

<p>There is no such thing as underachievement.</p>

<p>I didn't do better because I simply couldn't. I couldn't have worked
harder, been more disciplined or have acheived greater things.</p>

<p>This realisation is difficult to accept, but liberating. I can now
focus on the future, and leave the past where it should be.</p>
