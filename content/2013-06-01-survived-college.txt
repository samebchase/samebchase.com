### Eight semesters later: Sanity intact

I have passed four years of university. That's four years of
coursework and eight semester examinations. I think that's a
considerable acheivement. (self-back-pat)

It has been an overall positive experience. The only negative is that
I could not study harder. However, I've learned many things about the
world, about people and most importantly, myself.

I'm going to spend two months starting from today doing whatever I
want. Hopefully this will involve learning fun things and a bit of
exercise.

The rest of my life is ahead, waiting to be lived out.
