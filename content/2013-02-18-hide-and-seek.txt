The end of childhood

It was the last day of the summer vacation. I woke up late, and
played a computer game for several hours until four in the evening.

My friends arrived at around four and it was time for the usual
hide-and-seek, one of the games we had been playing for years.

After a few hours, it started getting dark so it was time for my
friends to go home. It was just like any other evening. I don't
remember feeling that it was any different.

It was to be the last time I played hide-and-seek with that set of
friends.

I woke up early the next day, as I had to leave for studying the 7th
Grade in a boarding school.

Childhood was great.
