Snakes and ladders

The events of our lives can sometimes seem to be random, unconnected,
and without meaning. Some wonder if He is playing a game of cosmic
snakes and ladders, their fate determined by a roll of the dice.

Others say that God is wilfully responsible for their
circumstances. Their happiness is dependent on their perception of how
well their situation is.

My situation in life has been quite easy for me, so far. I do not yet
claim to know the meaning of suffering or pain.

I dearly hope that if I ever feel like I'm stuck deep inside the dark
bowels of a snake, I realise that, actually, He is playing chess - in
God-mode.

The pawns which end up on the other side will be crowned.
