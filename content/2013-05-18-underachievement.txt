### Underacheivement

There is no such thing as underacheivement.

I didn't do better because I simply couldn't. I couldn't have worked
harder, been more disciplined or have acheived greater things.

This realisation is difficult to accept, but liberating. I can now
focus on the future, and leave the past where it should be.
