Uncle

A few months ago some friends of my sister came home. Upon seeing me,
one of them asked her: "Is he your uncle?". I did not mind it too much
at the time, and found it funny, because I had not spent much time at
home due to studying university interstate.

Again, recently, one of them addressed me as "Uncle", only to be
quickly corrected by her sister. I can assume that similar situations
are only going to increase in frequency, and this is something that I
had better get used to quickly. :-(

Greater responsibilities, and greater stresses are part of growing up,
and I am quite excited to take them on. Mistakes will prove to be
costlier as well.

Some say age is just a number - it is. It is also a standard of
behaviour that is expected of me, and a steadily increasing indicator,
as to how blessed I've been.
