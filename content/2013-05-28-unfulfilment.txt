Unfulfilment

A dancer should dance, and a hunter should hunt. Those are their
purposes of existence.

Doing anything else at the expense of working towards your purpose in
life will first result in frustration, and ultimately, a deep sense of
unfulfilment.

In the past few weeks, however, I've been doing the things that I
should. This allows me to rest at the end of every day knowing that
I've worked towards some of my purposes.
